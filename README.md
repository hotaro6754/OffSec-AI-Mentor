## ✨ The KaliGuru Advantage: What Makes Us Unique?

Unlike standard AI models (ChatGPT, etc.), KaliGuru is precision-tuned for the OffSec community:

1. **🛡️ Real-World Lab Hardstop**: KaliGuru strictly requires an authorized lab context (THM, HTB, Proving Grounds). It refuses to discuss targeting real systems, ensuring 100% ethical compliance.
2. **🧑‍🏫 Coach, Not a Tool**: It won't just hand you a script. It mentors you through the *logic* of enumeration and the *why* behind exploitation.
3. **📝 Professional Shorthand**: Responses use technical pentester notation:
    - `[+]` Success/Findings
    - `[-]` Risks/Mistakes
    - `[!]` Critical Warnings
    - `[>]` Commands/Actions
4. **🧠 OffSec Mindset DNA**: Precision-aligned with the "Try Harder" philosophy and current syllabi for **OSCP, OSEP, OSWE, OSDA, and OSED**.
5. **📱 Specialized Domains**: Expertise includes Kali NetHunter, Mobile Security (Android/iOS), Bluetooth Recon, and CAN bus (Car Hacking) theory.
